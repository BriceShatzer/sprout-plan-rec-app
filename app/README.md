The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `test`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>




## Notes

This project was bootstrapped with the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) which provides stuff like
[Babel](https://babeljs.io), [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io), & [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) out of the box.

Additionally, [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) for CSS preprocessing has been added.

### todo:
- add CSS preprocessing: [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)
